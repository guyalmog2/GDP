# GDP project - analyzing and predicting countrys' GDP based on socio-economic factors
the goal of this project, as a student of economics and psychology, was to integrate my passion and knowledge in the field of ecomonics and with my developing programming skills. 
in order to do that, i've chosen to gather some data regarding countrys' GDP and it's related factors, analyze it, and try to fit it into a regression model which will help to predict it correctly.
